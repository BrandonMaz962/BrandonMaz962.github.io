	  <h2>Projects</h2>
	  <p>I have worked on many projects of varying sizes and in many languages.
	  Below are some of my favorite projects that I have worked on that are also 
	  the most complete and functioning. Click on the project name to learn more.
	  </p>
	  <h3>Python</h3>
	  <ul>
		<li><a>Frog Jump</a></li>
	  </ul>
	  <p>Frogger style game where the player controls a frog sprite and using the arrow keys to move forward, left, right, and down tries to cross the road and reach the water on the other side. Collecting flies will lower your final time but getting hit by a vehicle will cause a game over. I made this game using python3 and pygame libraries.
	  </p>
	  <h3>Javascript / HTML</h3>
	  <ul>
	    <li><a href="./projects/blockBreak/blockBreak.html" target="_blank">Block Breaker</a></li>
	  </ul>
	  <p>Breakout style game where the player controls the platform on the bottom of the play area using the arrow keys to move left or right. Using the platform to bounce the ball the player tries to destroy all of the blocks. If all the blocks are destroyed you win however, if the ball falls off the screen then its game over. I made this game using a combination of javascript, html, and phaser3 libraries.
	  </p>
	  <ul>
		<li><a href="./projects/tlghWebsite/project/home.html" target="_blank">Company Website</a></li>
	  </ul>
	  <p>I have been browsing the web for years and have looked at thousands of websites. I always wondered how they were made and all the work it must take. After learning about HTML I decided to try it out and had a blast. Once the course I took was complete I wanted to build off that knowledge and create my own project. I reached out to a local business that is operated by some family members and asked to use them as practice. I then created a multipage website using HTML and CSS along with some other free logo generators and design tools.
