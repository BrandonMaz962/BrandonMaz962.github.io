	  <h3>Service Team Leader</h3>
	  <p>
	  Working as service manager I lead a team of about 50-60 people. I was responsible for writing the schedules and monitoring labor, training new hires during onboarding and working with current team members who were taking on new roles, monitoring performance metrics and daily reporting such as sales and customer satisfaction, driving results by communicating with the team and setting expectations, having weekly performance conversations, ensuring accountability by holding myself and others to deadlines and goals, managing ambiguity or the forever changing world of retail, collaborating with other leaders around the store, and various other daily job responsibilities to keep the front end running smoothly.
	  </p>
	  <p>
	  I was also tasked with running the entire service line for a few months where I gained experience conducting interviews and hiring new team members, contacting and organizing projects with third party vendors and services such as repairmen, cleaning crews, and landscapers, and fixing general low level IT issues when machines, registers, equipment, or terminals went down.
	  </p>
	  <p>
	  I received various systems experience through the technical troubleshooting of computers, printers, POS terminals, and handheld scanners.Examples of systems work I did include: adding a printer to the network when a computer couldn't find the device, replacing and installing new computers and coupon printers after they would break, answering software questions when colleagues ran into issues using various programs, and the inspection and repair of POS machines to remove stuck/jammed coins and bills from the internal components. One of the largest projects I had the opportunity to be a part of was the integration and restructure of a systems room to accommodate a shipment of new handheld devices and charging banks. I was responsible for removing everything from the room, then remodeling and rewiring each device to ensure that each computer, printer, scanner, and battery was plugged in, powered on/connected to the internet, and working correctly.
	  </p>
	  <h2>Internship</h2>
	  <p>During my previous work experience, I was very fortunate to get many opportunities to develop my soft skills. However I am now ready to work on developing my technical skills as well.
	  </p>
	  <p>While I have not had a job directly related to the field of computer science I am ready and eager to dive in and learn all that I can. I am open to work and looking for an internship or career opening.
