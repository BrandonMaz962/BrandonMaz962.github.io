	  <h3>Service Team Leader</h3>
	  <p>Working as service manager I lead a team of about 50-60 people. I was responsable for writing the schedules and monitoring labor, training new hires during onboarding and working with current team memebrs who were taking on new roles, monitering performance metrics and daily reporting such as sales and customer satisfaction, driving results by communicating with the team and setting expectations, having weekly performance conversations, ensuring accountability by holding myself and others to deadlines and goals, managing ambiguity or the forever changing world of retail, collaborating with other leaders around the store, and various other daily job responsabilities to keep the front end running smoothly.
	  </p>
	  <p>I was also tasked with running the entire service line for a few months where I gained expirence conducting interviews and hiring new team members, contacting and organizing projects with third party vendors and services such as reapirmen, cleaning crews, and landscapers, and fixing genral low level IT issues when machines, registers, eqipment, or terminals went down.
	  </P>
	  <h2>Internship</h2>
