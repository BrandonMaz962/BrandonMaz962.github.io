	  <h2>About Me</h2>
      <p>Hello, my name is Brandon Mazurkiewicz, a beginner IT guy from Michigan.  
	  I'm a quick learner and love to explore new technology and applications. 
	  Figuring out how things work, and trying to fix them when they don't, has always 
	  been facinating to me. The vast world of programming, IT, and computers once 
	  seemed to be a wolrd of magic and mystery. However, once I dove in I've been 
	  hooked ever since. My career in computer science is just beginning and I still 
	  have a lot to learn but I am very eager to get started!
	  </p>
	  <h2>Education</h2>
	  <p> After recieving my associates degree from Muskegon Community College in 2022, 
	  I transfered to Grand Valley State University in order to finish out my Bachlors 
	  degree. I am currently a senior and plan to graduate next Fall of 2024 with a 
	  major in computer scinece and a minor in mathematics.
	  </p>
	  <h2>Skills</h2>
	  <h3>Programming</h3>
	  <p>I have had the oppertunity to work with and learn many different programming 
	  languages both through my schooling, and through independant study.
	  </p>
	  <p>
	  I have completed projects in Java, C, HTML, and Python. I have also done work on 
	  a smaller scale using languages such as R, javascript, and C++. 
	  I have linked a few demo applications in the "My Projects" page of this site, 
	  along with a link to my github page at the bottom for other works and collaborations. 
	  </p>
	  <h3>Leadership</h3>
	  <p>I have worked in multiple leadership roles over the course of my career, including 
	  3 years as a Service Manager at Meijer. During this time I had the oppertunity to 
	  lead both small and large teams, along with working on developing and implimenting 
	  a new training program for team members when they are first hired on. Over the 
	  course of my time in retail I had many oppertunities to strengthn my soft skills 
	  working with a large variety of team members and customers alike. 
	  </p>
	  <p>
	  I also participated in many leadership development courses both online and in person. 
	  Most notable was a three month Team Lead Development Program where I worked with 
	  departments across the store to learn and strengten good leadership competencies 
	  such as; managerial courage, developing talent, time managment, managing ambiguity, 
	  ensuring accountability, and style flexing.
